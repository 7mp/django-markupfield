Don't use this.

my original implementation is at https://gist.github.com/67724/3b7497713897fa0021d58e46380e4d80626b6da2

a mailing list discussion derailed the initial version turning it into a crippled version of what I actually wanted.  I understand that this use case may be too specific for django core, but the proposed version had so little functionality and so much complexity it wasn't worth it

this version is in constant flux which is why i reiterate: Don't use this.
